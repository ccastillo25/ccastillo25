### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Carlos Castillo. I'm 28 years old, I was born in Los Angeles, California. I love to work out and watch sports, baseball being my favorite sport of all with the Dodgers being my favorite team. I am currently a student at UCSD extension for coding, on my journey to begin a career as a web developer. I have always been driven by my competitive spirit, and always wanting to be the best, and I will strive everyday to become the very best web developer I know I can be.
